[NAME = LEA]Did you all consume alcohol that night? If so, how much do you remember Kate drinking?
We were all a bit drunk, but I wouldn’t say we were wasted, we spent the night singing and dancing. 
Kate drank a few glasses of wine; she could just about walk but she was in no position to drive home, let’s put it that way.

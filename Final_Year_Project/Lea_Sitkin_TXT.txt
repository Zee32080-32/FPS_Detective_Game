[NAME=Lea Sitkin]
Hello, I’m Lea Sitkin. Last Saturday, on the 21st of September was my 24th birthday, we were all going to the Chinese restaurant, to celebrate it. 
We were meeting up there at 19.00 and as it not very far from her place and she wanted to have a few drinks, she walked and joined us. 
She was always on time, so she was at the table with Debbie, when I got there with Zhara. 
The evening was very nice, we had food and drinks and the restaurant was having a little karaoke. We all joined and sang with other people there.
We were all a bit drunk but not wasted, we were singing and dancing. Kate left us around 23.00 and it takes maybe 15-20 min by foot to get to her flat. 
She was meeting her boyfriend on Sunday so she didn’t want to stay out too late.
 As she lives close to the town centre, Kate was always going home by foot to her place, it’s usually very safe around here. 
 She always follows the main roads, which are well lit up and she usually called her boyfriend when walking home. She would not have got in a car with strangers, and she lives close-by. 
 She has a boyfriend, Dan, so she wasn’t looking at other boys. I can’t believe this has happened. I have lost one of my best friend.

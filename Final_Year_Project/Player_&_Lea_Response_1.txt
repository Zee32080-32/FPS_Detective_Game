[NAME = LEA]Kate left us around 23.00 and it takes around 15-20 minutes for her to walk home. 
She was meeting her boyfriend on Sunday, so she didn’t want to stay out too late. 
As she lives close to the town centre, Kate was always walking back to her place, it’s usually very safe around here. 
She always follows the main roads, which are well lit up and she usually called her boyfriend whilst walking home.

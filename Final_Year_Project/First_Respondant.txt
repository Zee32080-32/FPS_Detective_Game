We have cordoned the scene and the forensic pathologist did the first examination. We didn’t see anybody apart from the witness, it is very quiet here. We haven’t found any wallet, or phone, or ID. We’ll be checking announcements for missing person
Yes there is a suspicious patch of mud there- do you think that we should dig it up?
There is a suspicious car with no-one in but the passenger door was ajar and no-one has seen anyone going to that car…

I was just walking my dog, like every day when he just took off into this wood. I shouted for it to come back but I had to go and get it as he would not come back. I didn’t see anybody else on my way and I found this poor lady, next to this hole. I never saw her before, I don’t know who she is
I parked m car on the car park and there was only one light green car there but no-one inside. I didn’t see anybody and this was just the start of our walk. My dog seems very interested in that relatively fresh pile of mud, I just need to go and exercise it. I’ll leave you my details if you need to contact me again

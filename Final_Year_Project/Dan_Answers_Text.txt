I’m Dan, I’m Kate’s boyfriend. Sorry…was…Kate and I have been together for 3 years now and I was supposed to see her on Sunday. My job requires me to travel often, and I was trying to save a deposit so that Kate and I could buy our own place. I was staying at my parents’ house and I also stayed at Kate’s, where possible.[Answer 1]
I saw her on Thursday 19 th when we had dinner together. On the Saturday, she called me around 23.00 and said she had just left the restaurant and was walking home. She said she had a nice time but had drank quite a lot. This was not unusual, and she didn’t sound very drunk. She sounded happy. She said she looked forward to seeing me. I can’t believe that this was the last time I heard her voice. She was my soulmate.[Answer 2]
I’d say it was only a short conversation. 5 minutes maximum. I didn’t hear any other voices. She didn’t sound like she was distressed or being followed.[Answer 3]
Yes, she was beautiful, she had dark long hair and always presented herself well. She was 24 years old. She was quite sporty; she was always at the gym. Ordinarily I think that she would have been able to defend herself but then with a few drinks, she might not have noticed things the way she would have normally.[Answer 4]
No, she didn’t mention anything.[Answer 5]

[Option 3] So how would you say that Kate Brown was killed
[Response 3] I’m certain that she was strangled.

[Option 4] When would you say she was killed?
[Response 4] I have placed her death between 00.00 and 01.00 on 22/09/2019, so not that long after she was taken.

[Option 5] Can you confirm that she was sexually assaulted?
[Response 5] yes, I reported my observations that we didn’t find any semen and the suspect may have used a condom but there were traces of violence and lacerations in vagina and anus which would confirm she was raped. The bruises can on her forearms and tights suggest that she resisted and tried to escape.

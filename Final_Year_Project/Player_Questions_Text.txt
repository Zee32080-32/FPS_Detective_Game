[Option 1] Did you all consume alcohol that night? If so, how much do you remember Kate drinking?
[Response 1] We were all a bit drunk, but I wouldn’t say we were wasted, we spent the night singing and dancing. Kate drank a few glasses of wine; she could just about walk but she was in no position to drive home, let’s put it that way.

[Option 2] Do you recall when you left?
[Response 2] Kate left us around 23.00 and it takes around 15-20 minutes for her to walk home. She was meeting her boyfriend on Sunday, so she didn’t want to stay out too late. As she lives close to the town centre, Kate was always walking back to her place, it’s usually very safe around here. She always follows the main roads, which are well lit up and she usually called her boyfriend whilst walking home.

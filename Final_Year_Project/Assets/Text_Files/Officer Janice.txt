[NAME=OFFICER JANICE]Hello I am officer Janice and as you can see on the top right of the screen you have these panels 
press the 1 key to check your objectives, press the 2 key to check your options, press the 3 key to check your notepad,
press the 4 key to check your evidence book and press the 5 key to check your map. 
Once you have learnt how to use these panels check your map and start the game. GOOD LUCK!

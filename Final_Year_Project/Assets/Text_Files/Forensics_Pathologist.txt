[NAME=DR GERARD]Iâ€™m Dr Gerard, Based on my observations of the crime-scene.  I would say that for the Initial report,...
it appears clearly that the victim has been strangled. 
As she is naked, I will investigate further for indications of sexual violence. 
She has bruises that indicate that she tried to fight off and escape. 
These elements will need to be confirmed in the autopsy report. 
It also looks as the victim was not killed here but was transported here.
We are going to take the victim back with us to do an autopsy.

[NAME=DOG WALKER]Yes, I’m the witness. I’m Kenza. I was just walking my dog, like every day when he just took off into this wood. 
I shouted for it to come back but I had to go and get it as he would not come back. 
I didn’t see anybody else on my way and I found this poor lady, next to this hole. I never saw her before, I don’t know who she is.  
I parked my car on the car park and there was only one light green car there but no-one inside. 
I didn’t see anybody and this was just the start of our walk. My dog seems very interested in that relatively fresh pile of mud, 
I just need to go and exercise it. I’ll leave you my details if you need to contact me again.

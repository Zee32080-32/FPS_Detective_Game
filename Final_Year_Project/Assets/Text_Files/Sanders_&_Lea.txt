[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Hello Miss Sitkin, my name is detective Sanders. 
We are meeting today to take your statement with regards to the death of your friend Kate brown whose body was found this morning in the park. 
Please take your time, you can take a break at any point. 
I understand how difficult this must be for you, and I want to thank you for your cooperation within this investigation. 
This interview will be video-recorded and my colleague who will also be present during the interview may interject to also ask some questions.
To begin, Miss Sitkin, please describe the nature of your relationship with Kate.
[NAME=LEA]Hello, I’m Lea Sitkin. Kate is my best friend …or at least she once was.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]I’m sorry for your loss Lea. May I ask you to recount what happened on Saturday the 21st of September?
[NAME=LEA]Last Saturday, on the 21st of September it was my 24th birthday. 
We were all going to a local Chinese restaurant to celebrate together. 
We met around 19.00, the restaurant wasn’t far from Kate’s place and so she decided to have a few drinks, she walked and joined us. 
She is quite punctual, so it wasn’t a surprise when she was already at the table with Debbie, when I got there with Zhara. 
The evening was amazing, we had food and drinks and on that day the restaurant was having a little karaoke session. 
We all joined and sang with the other people there.[Player Ask Question]
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Would you describe her as careful?
[NAME=LEA]She would not have got in a car with strangers, and she lives close-by. She has a boyfriend, Dan, so she wasn’t looking at other men. 
She always made sure that he or I knew she was home safe when she got back. 
That night, I knew she was calling Dan on her way out... 
so when I didn’t get a text that she arrived safely, I thought nothing of it. 
I can’t believe this has happened. I have lost my best friend.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Thank you for your cooperation, and I’m sorry for your loss.

[NAME=Police Officer]We are now considering this car as potential crime-scene. We have ran the number plate and it appears that this is a stolen car. It was stolen 2 weeks ago. 
It also seems linked to the disappearance of Miss Jess Huyton who was reported missing on the 14th of September... 
and was seen pushed into this car last Saturday in the early hours, as she walked home after an office party in town‚Äù. 
Did you look inside that bin over there?

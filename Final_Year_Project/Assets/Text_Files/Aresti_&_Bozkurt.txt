[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI] Hello, I am detective Aresti. We are meeting today to get your statement about the last time you saw Miss Walsh, on the Saturday 9th of June. 
As I told you before the interview, we have reasons to believe that Mary Walsh was murdered. 
Thank you for your cooperation in this investigation. 
This interview will be video-recorded and my colleague who will also be present during the interview may interrupt to also ask some questions. 
Can I ask you to say who you are and what your relationship with Mary was? 
[NAME=Sinem Bozkurt] I’m Sinem Bozkurt. I have known Mary since our first year at University. 
We both live in a Hall of residence and we’re in our second year, studying for a BSc in biology. 
We have been very good friends. Since she went missing, I struggle to eat and to sleep. I really miss her….. 
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]I’m sorry to hear Sinem. Our department can offer you some support and counselling session to go through this difficult time. 
I will give you the details after our interview. So, tell me about what happened on the Saturday 9 th of June 2018?
[NAME=Sinem Bozkurt] Well… Mary and I went to a little summer party organised in the local park, to celebrate the success of our exams. 
We got ready at mine and ate dinner too. I made some spaghetti I remember. (pause) 
Mary wasn’t much of a party girl, and she had just come out of a relationship and was pretty depressed. So I thought it would be good for her to have some fun.  
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]How did you get to the park? 
[NAME=Sinem Bozkurt]We walked there. Our hall of residence is not too far, maybe 20-30 minutes walk… 
The party was near the Wollaton Park Lake. She talked to a lot of people that night and I thought she was enjoying herself. 
However, just around 10pm she told me that she wasn’t feeling very well and that she wanted to go home. 
I offered to take her home, but she told me she’d already ordered an Uber as she wasn’t feeling like walking back. 
Mary was very suspicious of Taxis, she said that everyone could become a taxi driver and that there was no insurance,... 
while the Uber app…well it gave the badge and the identity of the driver it was more reassuring. She would never go into a stranger’s car.  
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]Did you see her leaving?
[NAME=Sinem Bozkurt]Yes, she came to say bye just after 10 pm I think. The next morning, I knocked on her door and nothing. 
I tried to ring her many times and nothing. I asked the Hall’s warden if we could open her flat as I thought she might have passed out unwell but... 
there were no signs that she even got home. 
As this was totally out of character, the Warden made me call the police to alert them of her disappearance. 
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]Do you remember what she was wearing on the day?
[NAME=Sinem Bozkurt]I have got pictures on my phone. She was wearing a lovely black dress, with her trainers and she had several bracelets that she just bought that week. 
Just those ….sort of silver bangles, nothing fancy really. That’s it, we hadn’t taken our jackets as it had been so sunny
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]Thank you for your help. Is there anything else that you want to add?
[NAME=Sinem Bozkurt]The party was a while ago now, so I think I told you everything….I must have come back to the halls around midnight and I didn’t cross her or see her. 
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]thank you for your help. Good bye.
[NAME=Sinem Bozkurt]thank you. Goodbye.

[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Hello Mr Petrosian, my name is detective Sanders. 
We are meeting today to take your statement with regards to the death of your girlfriend Kate brown whose body was found this morning in the park. 
Please take your time, you can take a break at any point. 
I understand how difficult this must be for you, and I want to thank you for your cooperation within this investigation. 
This interview will be video-recorded and my colleague who will also be present during the interview may interject to also ask some questions. 
To begin, Mr Petrosian, please describe the nature of your relationship with Kate.
[NAME=DAN PETROSIAN]I’m Dan, I’m Kate’s boyfriend. Sorry…was…Kate and I have been together for 3 years now and... 
I was supposed to see her on Sunday. My job requires me to travel often, and... 
I was trying to save a deposit so that Kate and I could buy our own place. 
I was staying at my parents’ house and I also stayed at Kate’s, where possible.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]When was the last time you saw Kate?
[NAME=DAN PETROSIAN]I saw her on Thursday 19 th when we had dinner together. 
On the Saturday, she called me around 23.00 and said she had just left the restaurant and was walking home. 
She said she had a nice time but had drank quite a lot. This was not unusual, and she didn’t sound very drunk. She sounded happy. 
She said she looked forward to seeing me. I can’t believe that this was the last time... 
I heard her voice. She was my soulmate.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Can you tell me little about your last conversation?
[NAME=DAN PETROSIAN]I’d say it was only a short conversation. 5 minutes maximum. 
I didn’t hear any other voices. She didn’t sound like she was distressed or being followed.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Can you tell me a little more about Kate? What was she like?
Yes, she was beautiful, she had dark long hair and always presented herself well. She was 24 years old. 
She was quite sporty; she was always at the gym. Ordinarily I think that she would have been able to defend herself but then with a few drinks,...
she might not have noticed things the way she would have normally.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Has she told you about anyone new that she may have met?
[NAME=DAN PETROSIAN]No, she didn’t mention anything.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SANDERS]Thank you for your cooperation, and I’m sorry for your loss. Goodbye
[NAME=DAN PETROSIAN]Thank you. Goodbye.

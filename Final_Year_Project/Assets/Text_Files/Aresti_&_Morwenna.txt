[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]Hello, I am detective Aresti. We are meeting today just to talk about the statement
you made after the police made a call to anybody who would have had any information about the disappearance of Miss Walsh, on the Saturday 9th of June. 
As I told you before the interview, we have reasons to believe that Mary Walsh was murdered. 
Thank you for your cooperation in this investigation. 
This interview will be video-recorded and my colleague who will also be present during the interview may interrupt to also ask some questions.
Can I ask you to say who you are and whether you knew Mary?
[NAME=Morwenna]I am Morwenna, I work at the University but I didn’t know Mary no. 
I responded to the police call for witness after something caught my attention on that night.
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]Could you please explain to me what happened?
[NAME=Morwenna]On the 9 th of June, around 22.15, I was at my window, smoking a cigarette….. 
I live right across from the student campus and... 
I’m used to their parties especially at the end of the year. 
This is not unusual to see young people having barbecues and put music on and dance there in the summer. 
….I saw this girl in a black dress, with no jacket, by the side of the road she was walking towards the other end of the park. 
I didn’t pay much attention until I heard her arguing loudly and leaving furiously. 
I didn’t see the other person but I saw a car arriving a few minutes after and wait there for a bit, before turning around.
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]What sort of car was this? Could it have been a taxi?
[NAME=Morwenna]It was a Toyota I think…..but not 100% sure. 
Yes, I guess it could also have been a Uber, but I couldn’t see very well, it wasn’t a black cab though.
…..When I called the police after seeing the advert calling for witnesses to come forward,...
I thought this might be completely irrelevant but as they said it happened on the same night in the park……
I wouldn’t be able to recognise her though as I only saw her from my window. 
It’s the fact that they seem to have a loud argument that made me wonder what was happening.
[NAME=DETECTIVE ARESTI]Anything else? (pause); Thank you for your help. Good bye
[NAME=Morwenna]thank you. Goodbye.

[NAME=DETECTIVE SMITH]Hello Sally, my name is detective Smith. We are meeting today to take your statement... 
with regards to the death of Jess Huyton, as you heard that we found her this morning. 
Please take your time, you can take a break at any point. I understand how difficult this must be for you, and... 
I want to thank you for your cooperation within this investigation. 
This interview will be video-recorded and my colleague who will also be present during the interview may interrupt to also ask some questions.
To begin, Sally, please describe the nature of your relationship with Kate.
[NAME=Sally]Hello, I’m Sally and I’m a colleague and friend of Jess. I have known her for years now and we’ve been working together for the last 5 years. 
On that Friday 13 th of September, after work, we had an office party in town and we went there together.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SMITH]Could you please describe Jess to us?
[NAME=Sally]Jess was 25, yes, she was quite pretty, she had nice long hair. She was very slim. She was also friendly.
We talked quite a lot on that night, we are both single and we were talking about how it can be difficult to meet someone these days. 
Her parents had bought her this lovely ring with a ruby and pearl earrings and she was wondering if one day, she would get to wear a wedding ring…… of this is so sad…
[NAME=DETECTIVE SMITH]Just take your time, Sally... So what happened at the end of the party? How did she leave?
[NAME=Sally]She didn’t live very far and usually she would take a taxi, but she decided to walk off the alcohol and have some fresh air. 
I had asked her to text me when she got home but she never did. It was probably 02.00AM.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SMITH]Do you think she may have got in a taxi?
[NAME=Sally]No, I don’t think she would. I would assume that someone had to force her in a car, she wouldn’t have gotten I a stranger’s car at that time of night! 
I wouldn’t say she looked very strong. 
I don’t think that it would have been difficult to overpower her or to carry her in a car you know.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SMITH]It is possible. Thank you very much for your help. Is there anything else you can think of?
[NAME=Sally]Not really, I’m just so shocked by what happened, this is so scary.
[NAME=DETECTIVE SMITH]Well, if you remember anything else then just give us a call.
[NAME=Sally]I will officer, thank you. Goodbye
[NAME=DETECTIVE SMITH]Goodbye

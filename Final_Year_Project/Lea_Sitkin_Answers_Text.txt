Hello, I’m Lea Sitkin. Kate is my best friend …or at least she once was.[Answer 1]
Last Saturday, on the 21st of September it was my 24th birthday. We were all going to a local Chinese restaurant to celebrate together. We met around 19.00, the restaurant wasn’t far from Kate’s place and so she decided to have a few drinks, she walked and joined us. She is quite punctual, so it wasn’t a surprise when she was already at the table with Debbie, when I got there with Zhara. The evening was amazing, we had food and drinks and on that day the restaurant was having a little karaoke session. We all joined and sang with the other people there.[Answer 2]
She would not have got in a car with strangers, and she lives close-by. She has a boyfriend, Dan, so she wasn’t looking at other men. She always made sure that he or I knew she was home safe when she got back. That night, I knew she was calling Dan on her way out so when I didn’t get a text that she arrived safely, I thought nothing of it. I can’t believe this has happened. I have lost my best friend.[Answer 3]
